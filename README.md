**Dynamic Mosaic Automation Tool v2 Artkive**




Description
This tool automates the creation of 5x5 mosaic and 3x3 Crayola products. It takes in a directory of order folders, then generates a mosaic by selecting, editing, and arranging the images to construct the desired mosaic. It also has a review step in order for the user to verify the results generated by the tool.

**Features/Steps**
- Automatically goes through each order folder in the 'Orders in Progress' folder
- Selects the most colorful, most contrasty images from the folders and crop them to remove the white border
- For a 5x5 mosaic, it selects the top 5 colorful images and places them in the coordinates 1, 5, 13, 21, 25. And then randomizes the order of other images. For a 3x3 crayola, only the top 9 pictures are kept, and then they are placed in random order
- For images that are not round (includes 3D), the tool selects a pastel toned complementary color and sets it as the background in order to present the 'grid feel' in the image
- Outputs mosaic image file

**Assumptions**
- The order folders will have the order number as their folder name
- There will always be a pure white border stroke in each image

  
Usage
Place source image in root directory
Place directory of tile images in tiles directory
Run python mosaic.py
Output mosaic image will be saved to mosaic.jpg
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV Python package
NumPy Python package
Examples
Copy code

python mosaic.py --source image.jpg --tiles tiles/
This will generate a mosaic called mosaic.jpg using the image image.jpg as the source and the images in tiles/ as the tile set.
