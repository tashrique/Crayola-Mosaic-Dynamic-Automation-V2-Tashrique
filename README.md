### Dynamic Mosaic Automation Tool v2 Artkive üë®üèª‚Äçüíª


## Description

This tool automates the creation of 5x5 mosaic and 3x3 Crayola products. It takes in a directory of order folders, then generates a mosaic by selecting, editing, and arranging the images to construct the desired mosaic. It also has a review step in order for the user to verify the results generated by the tool.

## Features/Steps
- Automatically goes through each order folder in the 'Orders in Progress' folder
- Selects the most colorful, most contrasty images from the folders and crop them to remove the white border
- For a 5x5 mosaic, it selects the top 5 colorful images and places them in the coordinates 1, 5, 13, 21, 25. And then randomizes the order of other images. For a 3x3 crayola, only the top 9 pictures are kept, and then they are placed in random order
- For images that are not rectangular (includes 3D), the tool selects a pastel-toned complementary color and sets it as the background in order to present the 'grid feel' in the image
- Once the PSD files are generated, they can be opened and edited (change image position, change image size, translate image within the mask).
- Finally, the 'Finalize' script is used to generate the printing high-resolution JPG and the customer-proof Frame JPG.

## Assumptions
- The order folders will have the order number as their folder name
- There will always be a pure white border stroke in each image
- The order folders will have the images directly inside them, with no subfolders
- The PSD files are open in photoshop before running the finalize script

  
## How to Use

These are the files and folders that will be visible to the user. In order to start the automation, copy all the order folders inside the `Orders in Progress` and double click the `Start Crayola-Mosaic Automation`
shortcut. You will be prompted with the following dialog box:

Select the automation you want to run. After you click run, it will start generating the PSDs. The PSDs will be saved in a folder named `000 Output Month-Day` format like the following:

When the PSDs are done generating, you can go inside the output folder and open all the PSDs in Photoshop and edit as you need. You will also have a file called `Shuffle.atn` inside the `Source Code` folder that you can import into Photoshop as an action folder. This action can be used to rearrange the images in the mosaic. It has two actions separated for Mosaic and Crayola.

After you are done reviewing the PSDs, don't close them. Keep them open and run the `Finalize` script. This will generate a High-Res JPG for print and a Customer Proof Frame for each of the files that are open in Photoshop currently. It will close every doc afterward.
